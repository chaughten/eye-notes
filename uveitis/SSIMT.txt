steroid-sparing immunomodulatory therapy

before starting SSIMT
        ALWAYS:
          perform a pregnancy test
          counsel the patient about
            need for birth control
            birth defects
              methotrexate
              mycophenolate
            subsequent fertility issues
              alkylating agents like cyclophosphamide probably reduce fertility
                fortunately we don't use them much for uveitis
      start SSIMT
        if they have a known systemic disease causing their uveitis
        good control but very high IOP
        unable to taper systemic steroids
        systemic steroid side effects
      once you start SSIMT
        expect to keep them on it for at least 24 months
      methotrexate
        mechanism
          folate analog antimetabolite
        dose
          adults
            15–25 mg po/week
          kids
            0.5–0.8 mg po/kg/week
          + folic acid 1 mg po daily
            usually given as 5 mg po q week in a single dose
            give folic acid the day after methotrexate
              same-day administration reduces the effect of methotrexate
            some docs only give folic acid for patients with side effects
              nausea
              vomiting
              abdominal pain
              abnormal LFTs
              mouth sores or ulcers
          dose can also be calculated in terms of BSA
            COMMON: when dosing children
            BSA formula
              easiest is Mosteller
                BSA = sqrt(height (cm) x weight (kg)/3600)
            for uveitis
              10–20 mg/m2
                20–40 mg/m2 is possible but atypical
          oral absorption is not as good as parenteral
            oral absorption is ~ 30%
            parenteral absorption is nearly 100%
              IM
              SC
              IV
            the difference is most important at 15+ mg/week
        side effects
          liver
          lungs
            pneumonitis
            pulmonary fibrosis
          not safe in pregnancy or breastfeeding
            spontaneous abortion
            birth defects
        follow
          LFT
          FBC
          UEC
          @ 0, 4, & q 8–12 weeks
      mycophenolate
        mechanism
          blocks a key enzyme in DNA synthesis
        adults
          1–1.5 g po bd
        kids
          600 mg/m2 po suspension bd
        side effects
          liver
          bone marrow
          not safe in pregnancy or breastfeeding
            spontaneous abortion
            congenital malformations
        follow
          LFT
          FBC
          @ 0, 2, 4, & q 8 weeks
      cyclosporine
        mechanism
          calcineurin inhibitor that blocks IL2 synthesis
        2–4.5 mg/kg/day split bd
        side effects
          kidneys
            including 2˚ HTN
          pregnancy
            does cross the placenta
              not harmful to the baby that we're aware of
            does cross into breastmilk
              not harmful to the baby that we're aware of
            limited data
              need to discuss it with the patient
        follow
          BP
          UEC
          FBC
          @ 0, 2, 4, & q 8 weeks
      TNFI
        good for JIA failing methotrexate
        side effects
          TB exacerbation
          demyelinating disease
          infusion reactions
          2˚ malignancies
          pregnancy
            does cross the placenta
            women treated during pregnancy have still had healthy babies
            does not appear to affect breastmilk
            limited data
              need to discuss it with the patient
        infliximab
          the TNFI we have the most experience with
          3–10 mg/kg SC q 2 weeks
            can start as low as 20 mg SC q 2 weeks in kids
          keep the patient on methotrexate
            it potentiates the effect of infliximab
        adalimumab
          30- kg
            20 mg IM q 2 weeks
          heavier than that
            40 mg IM q 2 weeks

anterior uveitis
  risk of visual impairment doubles @ SUN 0.5+ WBC versus SUN 0

intermediate uveitis
  1˚ cause of visual loss is CME
  if no CME
    may observe
  treatment
    regional
      periocular
      intravitreal
        100% incidence of cataract after 5 IVT
      100% recurrence of CME with regional alone
        so nearly always use systemic
    systemic

Jabs prednis(ol)one regimen
  1 mg/kg/d 60- mg max
    60+ mg greatly increases the risk of ischemic necrosis of bone
  taper after 2–4 weeks
    if you can't taper
      SSIMT
  goal
    SUN 0
    under 7.5 mg/kg/d
  Jabs does not use prophylactic PPI
    NSAIDs cause PUD
      steroids potentiate NSAID-associated ulceration
      steroids alone have low risk of PUD
    PPI increases the risk of osteoporosis
  calcium + vitamin D is an optional adjunct
    per Jabs
      calcium alone may increase the risk of MI
    most sources I read say MI risk is slightly increased ± vitamin D
  weigh your patients
    Hawthorne effect
      measured behavior is modified behavior
  taper
    60–40 -10 mg/(week OR 2 days if rapid)
    40–20 -5 mg
    20–10 -2.5 mg
    10- -2.5–1 mg

monitoring SSIMT
  bloods 4–6 weeks

start SSIMT at diagnosis
    COMMON:
      JIA
      MC ± P
      BSCR
      VKH

choice of agent
  mycophenolate OR methotrexate
  efficacy
    mycophenolate > methotrexate
    cyclosporine has poor efficacy
  tolerance
    mycophenolate > azathioprine
    cyclosporine is poorly tolerated

mycophenolate
  mycophenolate mofetil AKA Cellcept
    2–3 g daily
      divided bd
    diarrhea
      less if you ramp up slowly
    in children // see Doycheva, BJO 2016
      225 mg/m2 bd x 1 week
      then 450 mg/m2 bd
      ± prednisolone 1 mg/kg/d
        taper
          10 mg/week to 30 mg/d
          5 mg/week to 20 mg/d
          2.5 mg/week to 0 mg/d
  enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium AKA Myfortic
    reduces GI side effects
    dose conversion
      360 mg mycophenolate sodium = 500 mg mycophenolate mofetil

cyclosporine
  avoid in psoriasis
    these patients are often on PUVA OR topical cyclosporine
    po cyclosporine potentiates PUVA and topical cyclosporine skin cancer risks

alkylating agents
  cyclophosphamide
  chlorambucil
  avoid in the young
    especially for duration 2+ years
  high risk of cancer
    COMMON: nonmelanotic skin cancer
    all agents have some risk but this class is the worst

TNFI
  use first line for Behcet
  COMMON: in combination
    methotrexate
    mycophenolate
  if using TNFI in intermediate uveitis
    ALWAYS: MRI
      TNFI make MS worse
  hard to taper
    Foster BSCR data indicates they may need treatment for life
  increased nonmelanotic skin cancer

once SSIMT initiated
  treat 3+ y regardless of activity
  treat 2+ y inactive
  data is from a study in JIA

if SSIMT is inadequate but not ineffective
  add a 2nd agent
  you may be able to lower the dose of 1 or both once controlled
