AMD
  high IR iron levels may generate more free radicals
    some doctors recommend avoiding supplements with iron in AMD patients
    AREDS2 vitamins increase iron absorption
      avoid in iron storage diseases
        hemochromatosis

PCV
  visible polyps on exam
  layered blood in a PED
  SHRM overlying a PED
    nonspecific
      suggestive of polyp OR CNV
  OCT
    DLS
      RPED over flat Bruch
      COMMON:
        concurrent SRF
        undulating RPE + DLS
          often adjacent to the PED
          corresponds to BVN on ICG
          HR material between the layers represents the BVN/CNV
      personally I question this
        DLS is present in many cases of typical AMD if you look for it
    TLP
      notched peak at the edge of the PED
      may show a polypoidal lumen or HR material
    PED
      PED alone doesn't help distinguish from typical AMD
      2+ OCT signs
        PED + DLS
        PED + TLP
        DLS + TLP
        picks up 90% of PCV
        15% of typical AMD will have 2+ signs
          not foolproof but probably as good as ICG
            when combined with
              exam
              demographics
  ICG
    BVN
      often feeds into PCV
  treatment
    antiVEGF
    PDT
      early EVEREST 2 trial results suggest
        PDT + antiVEGF is superior to antiVEGF alone

non-AMD drusenoid phenotypes

EFEMP1
  dominant drusen
    look for PP drusen
      COMMON: nasal
  malattia Leventinese
    radiating pattern of drusen
  NOTE: don't listen to people who treat these as different diseases
    there is a continuum of phenotypes and the names predate genetics
